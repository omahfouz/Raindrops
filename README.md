Raindrops
=========


Have a raindrop class.
Have a catcher class.
A single rain drop falls every 2 seconds.
the catcher follow the mouse.
The catcher recognizes when it touches a raindrop and moves to three heights on top of the screen and the score increases by 1.
Lives/regenerations decrease everytime a raindrop is missed.
Once the player runs out of regenerations an emotional end screen appears.
Malfunctions:
so many raindrops may be loaded at once so that the program is overwhelmed.
